# MCMC for generating the posterior distribution of the average treatment effect from the Bayesian exponentially tilted empirical likelihood

This repository contains the R code supporting the paper by Yu Luo Daniel J Graham and Emma J McCoy (2023) ["Semiparametric Bayesian doubly robust causal estimation"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378375822001124), published in <em><strong>Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference</strong></em>.

The folder contains the R code for MCMC function to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) via the Bayesian exponentially tilted empirical likelihood using partially linear regression

-	<strong>BETEL_PS_cov_func</strong>: function to generate the posterior sample of the ATE via the Bayesian exponentially tilted empirical likelihood.
